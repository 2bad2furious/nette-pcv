should a manager trigger other managers directly or should it trigger all listeners - plugin support vs. instancing every single manager every single time

tree of pages? - ok

header - floating div with form on add - ok

manager calling in presenter through one method like commonTryCall(callable $action) - ok

inTransaction use in managers - common method - ok

wrappers for all db classes - page|header|setting|Tag - almost

show only options the user has rights for

get rid of pageType class - ok

inconsistency in adminbar vs real administration - LANGUAGE - ok

language has all its settings, settings only store the global and custom ones - ok

add page displayTitle form- ok

manager getters for important constants

dashboard - home and 404s set and public

no js support for page - show (one form with names like keys for params)

settings form with length limitation

add limits to sql queries where needed - performance boost

addSuccess/Error/Warning add parameters

tinymce?

jquery ui memory-leak/initing everything on create and on remove remove
